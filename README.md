<b>Web-Antiplagiarism</b> is a program that compares the original text with a test fragment (a fragment of text entered by the user). The basis is taken such a system for determining plagiarism: 

- first, we select <code>1, 2, 3</code> words from a fragment of the text, the entered by user, and check if there is such a sequence of words in the original text;
- then select <code>2, 3, 4</code> words and again look for them in the text and etc.;
- after a complete analysis of the text we will calculate the percentage of matching selections and draw a conclusion about the uniqueness of the text.
